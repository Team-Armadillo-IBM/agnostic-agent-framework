# Code review notes

## Overall architecture
- The orchestration is cleanly decomposed into planner, executor, and reflector
  components that are composed by `agentic_framework.agent.Agent`. The entry
  point simply coordinates these responsibilities without duplicating business
  logic, which keeps the workflow easy to extend.
- Configuration handling in `agentic_framework.config.Config` provides a
  user-friendly API while also validating critical sections (agent metadata,
  LLM information, and tool definitions). The lightweight YAML fallback is a
  nice touch for environments where PyYAML is unavailable.

## Strengths observed
- `Executor` enforces tool presence per step and captures runtime metadata such
  as execution duration, which feeds directly into reflective summaries. This
  provides observability with minimal overhead.
- Tool implementations are deterministic by default. For example, the
  in-memory SQLite tool and canned HTTP responses make the default fixtures
  stable across runs, which is excellent for experimentation and testing.
- The Docling adapter is defensive: it gracefully degrades when optional
  dependencies are missing and performs best-effort extraction even when APIs
  differ across Docling versions.

## Opportunities for improvement
- Consider validating plan steps during configuration parsing so that missing
  tools are surfaced earlier. Currently a typo is only caught at execution time
  when `ToolRegistry.get` raises a `KeyError`.
- `SQLTool` opens an in-memory connection per instance but does not expose a
  way to close it. If long-lived agent processes create and destroy many tools
  dynamically, providing an explicit `close` method (and invoking it from the
  registry) could help release resources promptly.
- The optional Docling pathway writes temporary files when converting raw
  strings. Wrapping the file cleanup in a `try/except` that logs failures would
  make diagnostics easier if deletion fails on unusual filesystems.

## Testing
- The included unittest suite (`python -m unittest discover -s agentic_framework/tests`)
  completes quickly and should be run after modifying planner, executor, or tool
  logic.
